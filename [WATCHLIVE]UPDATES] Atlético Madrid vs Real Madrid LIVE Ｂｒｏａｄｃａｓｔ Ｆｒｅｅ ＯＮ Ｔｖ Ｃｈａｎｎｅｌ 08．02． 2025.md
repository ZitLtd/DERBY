Why you should back Atletico Madrid
This Atletico squad has a nice balance of offense and defense, which is how they have been able to keep pace with Real Madrid's red-hot attack in recent meetings. The last two head-to-heads have ended in 1-1 draws, while Atletico won the previous meeting 4-2 in the Copa del Rey. Antoine Griezmann has scored eight goals in league play against Real Madrid, and he enters Saturday's match with three goals in three matches across all competitions.

Atletico's defense has also been impressive this season. They have kept a clean sheet in back-to-back matches and have only conceded 14 goals in 22 league matches. See which team to pick here.

Why you should back Atletico Madrid
Carlo Ancelotti's team has one of the most impressive attacks in Europe, even though fatigue and injuries to superstars have them grinding for wins. Real Madrid could be without Kylian Mbappe due to a calf injury and the team has a very congested schedule with Champions League, Copa del Rey and Supercopa matches taking place alongside league play. However, they tend to tighten up defensively against Atletico, which could make this game extra cagey.

It helps that Saturday's match is taking place at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid are 9-0-1 in 10 home league games this season and will enjoy having their home crowd to back them after four straight matches on the road. Prior to that four-game stretch, Real Madrid outscored opponents 19-9 over five home matches across all competitions. See which team to pick here.
