The match at Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, Spain, kicks off at 9pm local time (20:00GMT). Real, in the defence of their title, top the Spanish ... Real Madrid brace for a fierce showdown as they welcome cross-town rivals Atletico Madrid to the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu for a high-stakes La Liga derby this Saturday.

Los Blancos sit atop the table with 49 points from 22 outings, while Los Colchoneros are hot on their heels with 48 points, setting the stage for a clash that could have major title implications. Real Madrid will be determined to tighten their grip on first place, while Atletico will be aiming to throw a wrench in their plans—though even snatching a draw would be an upset.

Atletico Madrid have found the back of the net 19 times in their last 10 matches, conceding just seven while securing five clean sheets. Their most recent outing saw them claim a 2-0 home victory over Mallorca on February 1, with Samuel Dias Lino and Antoine Griezmann getting on the scoresheet.
