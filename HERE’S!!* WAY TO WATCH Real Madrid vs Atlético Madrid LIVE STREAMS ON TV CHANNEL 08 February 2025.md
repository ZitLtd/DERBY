Real Madrid will face off against Atletico Madrid in a highly anticipated Matchday 23 clash of the 2024/25 La Liga season. Here’s everything you need to know about kickoff times and how fans in the United States can watch the match on TV or stream it online.

This weekend’s Madrid Derby isn’t just another clash of La Liga titans; it’s a high-stakes showdown with league-altering implications. Real Madrid host Atletico Madrid in a crucial battle that pits the league leaders against their closest challengers.

Atletico, fresh off capitalizing on Real’s stunning upset loss to Espanyol last Matchday, now trails by a single point and has a golden opportunity to leapfrog their rivals for first place. Real, desperate to maintain their grip on the top spot, will be looking to fend off Simeone’s squad in what promises to be a must-watch encounter.

The Spanish capital of Madrid will host one of the biggest fixtures on the soccer calendar this weekend as its two teams, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, come head to head at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu on Saturday night, with a 9pm CET local time kick-off (3pm ET).

In a heated clash earlier in the season, the game was suspended after objects were thrown at Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. The match continued, with Atlético scoring an injury-time equalizer to secure a 1-1 tie.

Now, the teams occupy the top two positions in La Liga, with only one point between them, and three points of advantage ahead of FC Barcelona in third. As such, a win for Atlético at the Bernabéu, which hasn’t happened since 2016, would be enough to see them leapfrog Real Madrid and take top spot.
