Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid's La Liga table clash is taking place on Saturday. We have head-to-head records, live streaming details. Where to Watch Real Madrid vs Atletico Madrid? Britain and Ireland: The Madrid Derby will be broadcast live on LaLigaTV and Viaplay Sports.

The Madrid derby needs no stakes to make it one of the world's best rivalries, but this early-February meeting has plenty on the line as Real Madrid host Atletico Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.

The two sides are one and two in La Liga's table, with Los Blancos ahead by just a single point. With Barcelona lurking three points back in third, the potential winner of this match would go top of the standings while the loser would be in peril of dropping further back.

Real Madrid's defeat to Espanyol last time out (and subsequent outburst about the refereeing) put an even greater spotlight on this game, while Atleti have only won one of their past three league matches.

The course of the title race will be altered this weekend, in some way or another.

Moneyline lean: Draw (+255 on DraftKings)
Score prediction: Real Madrid 2-2 Atletico Madrid
Atletico Madrid are in great form, with just a single loss in any competition since October. Yet the Bernabeu has been a house of horrors for them: they are without a win at this venue since 2016.

Real Madrid, meanwhile, are barely keeping themselves afloat in both the league title race and the UEFA Champions League as they limp forward with an injury-stricken defensive line. There are reasons to back both sides in this rivalry bout, enough to ride the fence and play for a third straight draw between these two teams.

Real Madrid vs. Atletico Madrid best bet
Pick: Over 2.5 total goals
Odds: -140 (DraftKings)
This game screams goals. First and foremost, the obvious is that Madrid's back line is decimated. Eder Militao tore his ACL a second time, Antonio Rudiger picked up an injury possibly due to overuse, and David Alaba has gone down again after recovering from his ACL injury. That leaves just Jesus Vallejo, Raul Asencio, and an out-of-position Aurelien Tchouameni to fill in.

Atletico Madrid have been good up front this season, and Antoine Griezmann is rested, having come off the bench in each of his past two league games. Yet they are also missing a key defender in Robin Le Normand, who is suspended for yellow-card accumulation.

Speaking of rest, Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham were held out of Real Madrid's midweek Copa del Rey victory over Leganes and were given a lighter week of training, so they will be in tip-top shape.

Everything in this match points towards a back-and-forth affair.

Real Madrid vs. Atletico Madrid prop bet
Pick: Vinicius Jr to be booked
Odds: +270 on FanDuel
Despite playing just 1,270 of a possible 1,980 league minutes this season, Vinicius Jr. leads all players in this matchup with 22 fouls and five yellow cards this season. The forward has never been one to back down from a high-intensity game and can sometimes get suckered into a confrontation.

Four of Vini's five yellow cards this season, oddly, have come at home. Somehow, he's managed to avoid a booking in all nine of his career Madrid derby appearances, and that feels like an unsustainable record to maintain for the Brazilian lightning rod.
