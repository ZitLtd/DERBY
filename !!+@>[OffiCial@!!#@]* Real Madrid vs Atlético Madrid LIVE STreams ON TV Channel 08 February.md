Real Madrid vs. Atletico Madrid predicted lineups, team news
Real Madrid are in a world of hurt at the back. Having lost Dani Carvajal and Eder Militao for the season, they are also down Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who have both picked up recent muscle issues. Rudiger had been worked to the brink due to the already thin squad, while Alaba had only just returned from his long-term knee injury before going down again.

That leaves just Jesus Vallejo, Raul Asencio, and midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni as the options at centre-back. Full-back has also been a problem, as Carlo Ancelotti has rotated between Lucas Vazquez and Fede Valverde on the right, while platooning Ferland Mendy and Fran Garcia on the left.

Thibaut Courtois, Jude Bellingham, and Kylian Mbappe were all rested for the midweek Copa del Rey victory over Leganes but should return here for this massive rivalry match. Eduardo Camavinga isn't expected back for another few weeks due to a hamstring injury.

Real Madrid predicted XI (4-3-3, right to left): Courtois (GK) — Vazquez, Tchouameni, Vallejo, Mendy — Modric, Bellingham, Valverde — Rodygo, Mbappe, Vinicius Jr.

Injured: Militao (ACL), Carvajal (ACL), Rudiger (thigh), Alaba (muscle), Camavinga (hamstring)
Suspended: None

In contrast to their cross-town rivals, Atletico Madrid are in good shape overall with their squad availability.

They are without Robin Le Normand due to an ill-timed yellow-card suspension, but they otherwise have all their first-choice starters available for selection.

Pablo Barrios has returned to training after missing time due to illness, but Riquelme has been felled by a virus and missed out on Thursday, leaving his participation in doubt. Thomas Lemar has had an injury-plagued season and is not yet ready to return, still training individually at the moment.

Atletico Madrid predicted XI (4-4-2, right to left): Musso (GK) — Molina, Gimenez, Azpilicueta, Galan — Simeone, De Paul, Koke, Lino — Griezmann, Alvarez.

Injured: Riquelme (illness, doubt), Lemar (muscle)
Suspended: Le Normand (yellow-card accumulation)

Real Madrid vs. Atletico Madrid Prediction 
Real Madrid has been doing well this season but Atletico has kept pace with their more affluent neighbours.

Carlo Ancelotti is still searching for the right system to get the best out of his star-studded lineup. Real have an excellent record at home, winning nine out of the last 10 league games played here, while Atletico have managed to win just five away games this season.

Prediction: Real Madrid 2-1 Atletico Madrid
